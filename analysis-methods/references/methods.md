# Framework selection and data requirements

Adapted from DeerFlow consulting-analysis, Steps 1.1–1.5. Use this planning detail for substantive research and reports; a short answer does not require chapters or a written framework. Frameworks organize analysis, not evidence by themselves. User scope and available data determine which rows apply.

### Step 1.1: Understand the Research Subject

- Parse the research subject to identify the **core entity** (market, brand, product, industry, consumer segment, financial instrument, etc.)
- Identify the **analytical domain** (marketing, finance, industry, competitive, consumer, investment, macro, etc.)
- Determine the **natural analytical dimensions** based on domain:

| Domain | Typical Dimensions |
|--------|--------------------|
| Market Analysis | Market size, growth trends, market segmentation, growth drivers, competitive landscape, consumer profiling |
| Brand Analysis | Brand positioning, market share, consumer perception, marketing strategy, competitor comparison |
| Consumer Insights | Demographic profiling, purchase behavior, decision journey, pain points, scenario analysis |
| Financial Analysis | Macro environment, industry trends, company fundamentals, financial metrics, valuation, risk assessment |
| Industry Research | Value chain analysis, market size, competitive landscape, policy environment, technology trends, entry barriers |
| Investment Due Diligence | Business model, financial health, management assessment, market opportunity, risk factors, exit pathways |
| Competitive Intelligence | Competitor identification, strategic comparison, SWOT analysis, differentiated positioning, market dynamics |

### Step 1.2: Select Analysis Frameworks & Models

Based on the identified domain and research subject, select **one or more** professional analysis frameworks to structure the reasoning in each chapter. The chosen frameworks guide the **Analysis Logic** in the chapter skeleton (Step 1.3).

#### Strategic & Environmental Analysis

| **GE-McKinsey Matrix** | Industry Attractiveness × Competitive Strength | Business portfolio prioritization, investment decisions |

#### Selection Principles

1. **Domain-First**: Based on the domain identified in Step 1.1, select only the relevant frameworks needed to answer the question from the toolkit above
2. **Complementary**: Choose complementary rather than overlapping frameworks (e.g., macro-level with PESTEL + micro-level with Porter's Five Forces)
3. **Depth over Breadth**: Apply the selected methods deeply; there is no framework quota
4. **Data-Feasible**: Selected frameworks must be supportable by downstream data collection skills — if the data required by a framework cannot be reasonably obtained, downgrade or substitute
5. **Explicit Mapping**: In the chapter skeleton, explicitly annotate which framework each chapter uses and how it is applied

#### Framework Selection Output Format

```markdown
## Framework Selection

| Chapter | Selected Framework(s) | Application |
|---------|----------------------|-------------|
| Market Size & Growth Trends | TAM-SAM-SOM + Product Life Cycle | TAM-SAM-SOM to quantify market space, PLC to determine market stage |
| Competitive Landscape Assessment | Porter's Five Forces + Strategic Group Mapping | Five Forces to assess industry competition intensity, Group Mapping to visualize competitive positioning |
| Consumer Profiling | RFM + Consumer Decision Journey | RFM to segment customer value, Decision Journey to identify key conversion nodes |
| Brand Strategy Recommendations | SWOT + Blue Ocean Strategy | SWOT to summarize overall landscape, Blue Ocean to guide differentiation direction |
```

### Step 1.3: Design Chapter Skeleton

Produce a hierarchical chapter structure. Each chapter must include:

1. **Chapter Title** — Professional, concise, and appropriate to the user’s question
2. **Analysis Objective** — What this chapter aims to reveal
3. **Analysis Logic** — The reasoning chain or framework (must reference the frameworks selected in Step 1.2)
4. **Core Hypothesis** — Preliminary hypotheses, where relevant, to be validated or refuted by data

#### Chapter Skeleton Output Format

```markdown
## Analysis Framework

### Chapter 1: [Title]
- **Analysis Objective**: [This chapter aims to...]
- **Analysis Logic**: [Framework or reasoning chain used]
- **Core Hypothesis**: [Hypotheses to validate]
- **Data Requirements**: (see Step 1.4)
- **Visualization Plan**: (see Step 1.5)

### Chapter 2: [Title]
...
```

### Step 1.4: Define Data Query Requirements Per Chapter

For each chapter, specify **exactly what data needs to be collected**. This is the bridge to downstream data collection skills.

Each data requirement entry must include:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Data Metric** | The specific metric or data point needed (e.g., "China skincare market size 2020-2025 (in billion CNY)") |
| **Data Type** | Quantitative, Qualitative, or Mixed |
| **Suggested Sources** | Suggested source categories: Industry reports, financial statements, government statistics, social media, e-commerce platforms, survey data, news |
| **Search Keywords** | Suggested search queries for data collection |
| **Priority** | P0 (Required) / P1 (Important) / P2 (Supplementary) |
| **Time Range** | The time period the data should cover |

#### Data Requirements Output Format (per chapter)

```markdown
#### Data Requirements

| # | Data Metric | Data Type | Suggested Sources | Search Keywords | Priority | Time Range |
|---|-------------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|----------|------------|
| 1 | Market size (billion CNY) | Quantitative | Industry reports, government statistics | "China skincare market size 2024" | P0 | 2020-2025 |
| 2 | CAGR | Quantitative | Industry reports | "skincare CAGR growth rate" | P0 | 2020-2025 |
| 3 | Sub-category share | Quantitative | E-commerce platforms, industry reports | "skincare category share cream serum sunscreen" | P1 | Latest |
| 4 | Policy & regulatory updates | Qualitative | Government announcements, news | "cosmetics regulation 2024" | P2 | Past 1 year |
```

### Step 1.5: Define Visualization & Content Structure Per Chapter

For each chapter, specify the **planned visualization** and **content structure** for the final report:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Visualization Type** | Chart type: Line chart, bar chart, pie chart, scatter plot, radar chart, heatmap, Sankey diagram, comparison table, etc. |
| **Visualization Title** | Descriptive title for the chart |
| **Visualization Data Mapping** | Which data indicators map to X/Y axes or segments |
| **Comparison Table Design** | Column headers and comparison dimensions for the data contrast table |
| **Argument Structure** | The planned "What → Why → So What" narrative outline |

#### Visualization Plan Output Format (per chapter)

```markdown
#### Visualization & Content Plan

**Chart 1**: [Type] — [Title]
- X-axis: [Dimension], Y-axis: [Metric]
- Data source: Corresponds to Data Requirement #1, #2

**Comparison Table**:
| Dimension | Item A | Item B | Item C |
|-----------|--------|--------|--------|

**Argument Structure**:
1. **Observation (What)**: [Surface phenomenon revealed by data]
2. **Attribution (Why)**: [Supported drivers; label untested causal explanations as hypotheses]
3. **Implication (So What)**: [Strategic implications or recommended actions]
```
